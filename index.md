# WAND Group

WAND is the Network Research Group at the [University of Waikato](http://www.waikato.ac.nz/) [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/). The group is involved with a range of computer networks projects mostly focused around network measurement and software defined networks. The group has a strong international reputation and has close links, including collaborative research, with several other network measurement groups. These include CAIDA, [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/).

Our work includes collection of very long trace sets, network analysis and software to support this, active measurement systems, topology discovery and analysis and SDN controllers. Spinoff companies from our previous work include [Endace](http://www.endace.com/) and [Lightwire](https://www.lightwire.co.nz/).
